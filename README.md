# LangGraph CyberSecurity Agent
This repository contains a CyberSecurity Agent built using LangGraph, a framework for constructing stateful, multi-agent applications with Large Language Models (LLMs). The agent is designed to perform various cybersecurity tasks, including scanning for vulnerabilities and monitoring system activities.

# Features
**Vulnerability Scanning:** Utilizes integrated tools to detect potential security weaknesses in systems.

**System Monitoring:** Continuously monitors system activities to identify suspicious behavior.

**Multi-Agent Coordination:** Employs multiple agents working in unison to enhance cybersecurity measures.

# Installation

**Clone the Repository:**

```yaml
git clone https://github.com/Vansh41104/LangGraph_CyberSecurity_Agent.git
cd LangGraph_CyberSecurity_Agent
```

**Set Up a Virtual Environment:**

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```yaml
python3 -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Install Dependencies:**

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```yaml
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage

**Configuration:**

Before running the agent, ensure that all necessary configurations are set. This may include API keys, environment variables, or other settings required by the agent.

**Running the Agent:**

Execute the main script to start the cybersecurity agent:

```yaml
python main.py
```

The agent will initiate its processes, performing tasks such as vulnerability scanning and system monitoring.
